gridder
=======

Similar to Google Images Expander 

I'm creating this jQuery plugin as i was unable to find a similar one on internet. Please note that i'm very to Jquery, so 
do not hesitate to correct me if something seems completly wrong. This is mostly for learning purposes.

Live demo : http://www.oriongunning.com/demo/gridder/

```html
<div class="gridder">
  		<div class="gridder-list">
				<div class="thumb">
					<span class="overlay">Title 1</span>
				</div>

				<div class="gridder-content">
					<!-- Any Content you want to show in the expandiing panel -->
				</div>
				
			</div>
</div>
```


This is based on the Superbox plugin from Todd Motto : http://toddmotto.com/labs/superbox/
